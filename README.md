# Sebastien KLAY
Hi I'm Seb -  an alumni from üá®üá≠ in @heg-web and learning web development and programming.

## MY HOBBIES
After doing interviews for 2.5 years, about topics on personal development, as a personal project, I decided to dig the data privacy world with the secret media Youtube channel. I am now discovering the beautiful world of profiling and data harvesting. I am writing every day about that topic. Find out more in my GitHub projects and Youtube channel (in french). 

N.B. Please don't mind the projects about astronomy. I'm just a huge lover ü™ê

Throughout my projects and work, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to interview professionals about their skills and workflows. From my first YouTube channel to my role as an HES assistant in human-centered design, I conducted interviews to better understand people‚Äôs work and processes ‚Äî whether to create videos or to translate their needs into meaningful app features.

## How I Work
I must be in a creative environment. From where I work to the people I am working with. 
I am a person who LOVES learning. I ask a lot of questions.
I also need enough freedom in my projects in order to work efficiently and bring value to the team.
